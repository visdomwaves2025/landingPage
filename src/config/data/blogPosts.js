# Next.js 14 Performance Optimization: Complete Guide

Next.js 14 brings powerful features for building high-performance web applications. This guide covers everything you need to know about optimizing your Next.js applications for speed, SEO, and user experience.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
**Target**: < 2.5 seconds

Optimization strategies:
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use proper image sizing and formats
- Implement lazy loading
- Minimize render-blocking resources

### FID (First Input Delay)
**Target**: < 100 milliseconds

Improvements:
- Minimize JavaScript execution time
- Break up long tasks
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Implement code splitting

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
**Target**: < 0.1

Prevention:
- Set dimensions for images and videos
- Reserve space for ads
- Avoid dynamically injected content
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout properties

## Image Optimization

### Using next/image Component
\`\`\`typescript
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  priority // For above-fold images
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/..."
/>
\`\`\`

### Best Practices
- Use WebP or AVIF formats
- Implement responsive images
- Lazy load below-fold images
- Optimize image quality (80-85% is usually sufficient)

## Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation

### When to Use SSG (Static Site Generation)
- Content doesn't change frequently
- Data can be pre-rendered at build time
- Best for marketing pages, blogs, documentation

\`\`\`typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
\`\`\`

### When to Use SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Content changes frequently
- Personalized user data
- Real-time information required

\`\`\`typescript
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    cache: 'no-store' // Disable caching for SSR
  });
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
\`\`\`

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

### Dynamic Imports
\`\`\`typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false // Disable SSR for this component
});
\`\`\`

### Route-based Code Splitting
Next.js automatically code-splits by route, but you can optimize further:
- Keep pages lean
- Move shared components to a separate chunk
- Use dynamic imports for rarely used components

## Caching Strategies

### Static Assets
\`\`\`typescript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/images/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
\`\`\`

### API Routes
\`\`\`typescript
export async function GET() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
    headers: {
      'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=30'
    }
  });
}
\`\`\`

## Font Optimization

### Using next/font
\`\`\`typescript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
  variable: '--font-inter'
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Benefits:
- Automatic font optimization
- Zero layout shift
- No external network requests

## Bundle Size Optimization

### Analyze Your Bundle
\`\`\`bash
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer

# next.config.js
const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});

module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({});
\`\`\`

### Reduce Bundle Size
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use tree-shaking friendly imports
- Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- Dynamic import large components

## Database Query Optimization

### Use Connection Pooling
\`\`\`typescript
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
\`\`\`

### Implement Data Caching
\`\`\`typescript
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache';

const getCachedData = unstable_cache(
  async () => {
    return await database.query('SELECT * FROM posts');
  },
  ['posts'],
  { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour
);
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Implement Web Vitals Reporting
\`\`\`typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### Custom Metrics
Track custom performance metrics:
- Time to first byte (TTFB)
- API response times
- Component render times
- User interactions

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Optimize images (next/image everywhere)
- [ ] Minimize client-side JavaScript
- [ ] Implement proper caching headers
- [ ] Use CDN for static assets
- [ ] Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
- [ ] Remove console.logs and debugging code
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits
- [ ] Test on real devices
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

## Advanced Techniques

### Partial Prerendering
\`\`\`typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export const experimental_ppr = true;
\`\`\`

### Streaming with Suspense
\`\`\`typescript
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <DataComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
\`\`\`
